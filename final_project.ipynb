    "## Background and Research Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "With the growth of peer-to-peer accommodation platforms, Airbnb has become a dominant player in the short-term rental market across major cities worldwide. The pricing of Airbnb listings varies significantly, driven by numerous listing and location-specific characteristics. There are numerous studies examining this relationship for various reasons:\n",
    "- Understanding what factors are associated with the variation in Airbnb prices can help both hosts optimize their listings and travelers make more informed booking decisions.\n",
    "- Scholars have argued that the existence of Airbnb listings raise the cost of living for local renters as landlords are switching their property to cater short-term rentals, decreasing supply for long-term renters and driving up the rental rates over time (Barron et al., 2019).\n",
    "- The growth of Airbnb in neighbours that are not traditionally touristic brings economic growth to these areas, while also disrupting the hotel industry (Deboosere et al., 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "While many studies have identified factors associated with listing prices, fewer have evaluated whether these features can be used to *predict prices* with reasonable accuracy. In this project, we explore this predictive focus using Airbnb listings from three popular European cities: London, Rome, and Budapest."

This dataset provides information about 51,708 Airbnb listings in 10 popular European cities - Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona, Berlin, Budapest, Lisbon, London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset in the article was collected by web-scraping the Airbnb platform to look for accommodations for two people and two nights in 10 major European cities, 4-6 weeks in advance of the travel dates. Additionally, TripAdvisor was used to obtain reviews of nearby attractions/restaurants and Wikipedia was used to calculate the distance to the nearest metro station.\n",

    "## Methods and Plan\n",
    "The response variable `realSum` is continuous with an unbounded range (at least for positive values) so we will use multiple linear regression to obtain a predictive model for the price of a listing. Since the dataset contains many predictors, interaction terms will not be considered in order to maintain model simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will fit and compare multiple model selection methods and choose the model that provides the most predictive power by minimizing the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). RMSE is well-suited to test prediction accuracy as it directly measures the average magnitude of prediction errors in the same units as the response variable. The model selection methods we will test are:\n",
    "- Backward stepwise selection using `stepAIC()`\n",
    "- LASSO Regression (L1 regularization)\n",
    "- Ridge Regression (L2 regularization)\n",
    "\n",
    "To validate the RMSE from each model and avoid the post-inference problem, the data will be split into three sets: a training set, a validation set, and a testing set. Since the dataset is very large (roughly 23,000 observations), splitting the data into a third set will still leave plenty of data for each set while making RMSE validation easier to implement (as opposed to performing cross-validation). 60% of the data will be used to train the models, 20% of the data will be used to calculate and compare RMSE's, and finally the remaining 20% to fit our selected model to test its predictive power. This will let us avoid the post-inference problem we could potentially run into while selecting variables and fitting the model on the same data. Since a temporary variable was needed to split the data, data splitting was performed as a part of the data cleaning process to avoid leaving unnecessary variables in the dataset."

    "We will focus on the **GVIF^(1/(2*Df))** column to decide the variable selection process as our dataset contains multiple categorical variables. We observe that the values for `attr_index`, `attr_index_norm`, `rest_index`, `rest_index_norm`, `lng`, `lat`, and `city` are all greater than $\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.23$. This makes intuitive sense, since both the longitude and latitude of a listing would depend highly on what city the listing is in. It also makes intuitive sense that `attr_index` and `attr_index_norm` are highly correlated, since `attr_index_norm` is just `attr_index` but normalized to force the minimum and maximum attraction index to be 0 and 100 respectively (Gy√≥di & Nawaro, 2021). A similar conclusion is reached for `rest_index` and `rest_index_norm`, since `rest_index_norm` is calculated from `rest_index` in the same way.\n",

    "- `rest_index`: Since the generalized VIF of `rest_index` is greater than `rest_index_norm`, `rest_index` will be removed\n",
    "- `lng` and `lat`: We determined that city-specific factors are likely to be significant factors that determine the price of a listing, so it makes more sense to work with the categorical variable `city` than the numerical `lng` and `lat` variables"

Since the validation set is fairly large, the small differences in RMSE between the three models are unlikely to be a result of random chance.

    "The Ridge regression model, used to predict Airbnb listing prices in Budapest, London, and Rome, has an RMSE of $198.28$. Compared to the null model, the Ridge regression model reduces RMSE by approximately $20\\%$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients of Ridge regression are biased, so the exact value of the coefficients are not very meaningful to interpret. However, we can still interpret the relative magnitudes (compared to other predictors) and the sign (positive or negative) of each coefficient:\n",
    "- `cityLondon` (147.62) and `cityRome` (53.44) are dummy variables comparing each city to Budapest (the reference category). Their positive coefficients suggest listings are more expensive in London than in Rome than in Budapest, likely due to greater demand in those markets.\n",
    "- `room_typePrivate room` (-118.21) and `room_typeShared room` (-163.86) are dummy variables comparing different room types to entire home listings. The negative coefficients indicate private rooms, followed by shared rooms, are significantly cheaper than entire homes, likely due to fewer amenities and space.\n",
    "- `person_capacity` (19.93) indicates that larger listings that typically host more people offer more space or amenities and can charge higher prices.\n",
    "- `metro_dist` (-12.50) suggests that prices drop the farther a listing is from the nearest metro station, aligning with earlier findings that central locations command higher prices.\n",
    "- `attr_index_norm` (9.03) has a modest positive effect, indicating listings closer to attractions can charge slightly higher prices, though the impact is not as strong as metro access.\n",
    "- `dist` (0.25) and `rest_index_norm` (-1.36) have a surprisingly low effect on prices, implying that overall distance from the city center and nearby restaurant density may be less influential than direct access to transit, or that their effects are already captured by other, more dominant location variables. \n",
    "- `host_is_superhostTrue` (-10.38) is another dummy variable comparing the listing prices of SuperHosts to regular hosts. This is unexpectedly negative, possibly reflect SuperHosts setting more competitive prices to maintain high occupancy and meet performance standards. It could also suggest market saturation, where the abundance of SuperHosts reduces the price premium usually linked to their status.\n",
    "- `weekend` (8.86) shows a modest price increase during weekends, suggesting somewhat consistent pricing across weekdays and weekends.\n",
    "- `guest_satisfaction_overall` (0.78), `cleanliness_rating` (1.94), `multi` (-1.80), `biz` (-0.21) have small positive effects, implying these factors matter less in predicting prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, city and type of room are the most influential variables. Since we have observed in our analysis that the relationship of price with other characteristics of the listing changes for every city, we could look into interactions to further improve the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future research could examine seasonal trends to understand how demand fluctuations affect pricing. This could reveal periods of peak profitability, influence hosts‚Äô pricing strategies, and highlight how tourism cycles shape the dynamics of the local hotel industry and the rental market."
